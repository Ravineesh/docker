# Docker Installation

There are multiple ways to install the docker on your system.

The way which I found most convienent is using the convenience script

[On the terminal](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-convenience-script):

`curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh`

`sudo sh ./get-docker.sh`

After the installation is complete, you can check if the docker is installed by running the command

`docker version`
