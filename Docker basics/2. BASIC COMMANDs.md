# Docker Run

`docker run centos`

This command will run the centos image locally, if the image is not available locally it is going to pull the image from docker hub.

## Docker Run -tag

if you the command 

`docker run redis`

Then docker will be going to pull and run the latest image of redis from docker hub. Docker considers the tag to be **`latest`**.

So, what if you want to run another version of redis, for example an older version of redis. In that case, we have to use something called as **tag**. 

`docker run redis:4.0` 

After the **`:`** we are specifying the version of redis which we like to run. Docker, in this case will going to pull the image of redis having the version 4.0.


## Docker Run -STDIN

Docker containers by default does not listen to a _standard input_. In order to provide the input to the docker container, we have make the docker container interactive. Also, we have to attach a pesudo terminal to the docker container.

`docker run -it  'container_name'`

**`-it`**, where **`i`** is for interactive and **`t`** is for pesudo terminal
